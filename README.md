FiveM Shop Script


This is a simple shop script that i created while being bored, its nothing fancy but its simple enough and you can modify it to your liking.
Uses Nh-Context and qtarget, Choose which account the money gets took from in the config file
It has 16 shop coords already in the config and you can add as many as you want, blip settings can be adjusted in config also.
qtarget is used by zones and not entity
Pretty straight forward.
This can be customised to your liking and more items can be added or removed. Built around esx legacy 
any help you need then feel free to send me a message.
